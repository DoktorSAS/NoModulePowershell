# Overview
The existence of this project is a direct response to the challenges faced within corporate environments, where strict administrative controls often impede the installation of new modules on devices. This restriction can lead to significant delays in development processes and the completion of tasks. The project aims to provide an open-source collection of utility methods designed to simplify and expedite the development of PowerShell scripts.

It serves as a toolkit that empowers developers by providing a wide array of pre-built methods, enabling them to focus more on scripting logic rather than the intricacies of module installation and configuration. By doing so, it also lowers the barrier to entry for creating basic scripts, given the extensive suite of methods available at their disposal. This approach offers the dual advantage of accelerating development timelines and reducing the need for in-depth knowledge of the underlying systems. As a result, it promotes efficiency and productivity in an environment where such resources are often limited by administrative permissions.
